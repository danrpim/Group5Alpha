## Differences

A member of our team dropped so we are now down to two. The features that we initially planned to implement may not be completed. The revised plan is as follows:

### Alpha Phase:

Account Authentication Features: login, logout, register, and reset password


Branding: Design application logo


UI/UX Design: Implemented simple user interface and flow. Constraints have been added to accommodate varying devices, resolutions, and aspect ratios.


## Special Instructions
The initial page is the login. It also includes actions to register for an account and request a password reset link.
